    <div class="container">
        <h2>1. How To Difference Local Storage And Session Storage?</h2>
        <p>ans: sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't
            expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>2. How To Difference Global scope and Block Scope?</h2>
        <p>Ans : Global Scope : The Javascript global scope is the context where everything in a Javascript program
            executes by default. This scope includes all variables, objects, and references that are not contained
            within a customized scope defined by a programmer. Global scope is the entire Javascript execution
            environment. <br>
            Block Scope: A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are
            accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the curly
            braces are called as within block scope.</p>

        <h2>3. How To Work Javascript Event Loop?</h2>
        <p>Ans : The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack
            is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
            effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
